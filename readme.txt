Blood Bank Management System
Introduction
This project created a Blood Bank Management System to automate and improve the management of blood supplies, donor data, and requests. The system was developed to address the problems caused by manual methods, such as inefficiencies and delays, which can be critical during emergencies.



Key Features

Blood Inventory Management: Tracks blood units in real time, categorized by blood type.




Donor Management: A centralized database stores donor details, including their contact information and donation history.




Blood Request Management: Manages requests from submission to fulfillment. It allows hospital staff or administrators to approve or reject requests based on available inventory.



Blood Transfer Tracking: The system monitors the delivery of blood units to patients or other facilities to ensure accountability.



User Roles: The system has different user roles, such as Admin and Staff, with specific permissions for secure access.



Technologies Used
The system was built using the following technologies:


Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create the user interface.






Backend: PHP was used for server-side scripting and interacting with the database.





Database: MySQL was used for data storage and management.



Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was used as the IDE.

Future Improvements
Future development could include integrating SMS or email alerts to notify donors and requesters
